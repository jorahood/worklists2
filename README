Development notes:

* list/show.dryml#<form>: removing owner="listed_doc" allows hobo to set the owner association for the note
    to the current user when the form is here in the cell of a table-plus of listed_docs for a certain list, just like when editing a note from a listed_doc show page
    FIXME: What use is the owner attr for forms? I thought I had to set it to the model that the note belonged to, but Hobo figures it out ok without it -->
