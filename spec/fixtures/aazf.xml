    <kbq>On my NeXT, why won't Mathematica work after I've installed it?
</kbq>
    <body>
<p>After you install Mathematica, you have to run MathInstaller.
MathInstaller asks you for various pieces of information, such as the
type of computer that you are using, your license number, and your
password (the publisher of Mathimatica, Wolfram, supplies the password).
</p><p>
You will then see a second menu for the creation of the full &quot;dumped&quot;
version of Mathematica's main executable file.  In that menu, you are
asked for the names of two directories where you will put
Mathematica's packages and command scripts.
</p><p>
You are then asked about the amount of <kbh docid="ahtx" access="allowed">memory<domain>all</domain><visibility>visible</visibility></kbh> currently available on
your machine. If you have relatively little memory, i.e., less than
16MB, highlight the first radio button; if you have plenty of memory
available, highlight the second radio button.  This option selects
whether the full <kbh docid="agsv" access="allowed">kernel<domain>all</domain><visibility>visible</visibility></kbh> of libraries will automatically be loaded, or
loaded as needed by Mathematica.
